Also submitted:
-art contest submission (the image was obtained using bnMorph on two sets of face images where the line segments matched were probably way too far apart, unfortunately I didn't have time to get a set of matching segments that produced a good morph of two faces)
-webm file of the bnMorph performed on F.bmp and F_rotated.bmp (titled f_morph.webm)
